                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                Hello! My name is Preston Pan, a student and programmer. Here is a little bit about myself:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>good at C and python, depending on who you ask</li>
                    <li>terrible css/webdev skills as you can tell by this website</li>
                    <li>learning linear algebra and cryptography</li>
                    <li>experimenting with x86-64 NASM assembly</li>
                    <li>card magic skills due to practising an amount that is unfathomable to the average person</li>
                    <li>day to day user and advocate of free software, or what is called "open source" software</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                Of course, these things aren't all who I am exactly, but it might give one an idea of
                what I like doing.
                </p>
                <p>
                Notice: my blog post about privacy has basically become an ever changing
                post, with frequent updates as I get more educated about privacy. It's basically
                turning into my attempt at an overall privacy guide, so check it out.

                I only use platforms that respect my privacy. Therefore, I do not have

                        but hopefully more people will learn about it. Also I am directing people to LBRY.

                <h2>Commissioning</h2>
                <p>
                If you want some software made for you, you can commission me. Message me via email, or preferably,
                matrix to do so. The software will be released under some sort of GPL license but it is not required
                that you distribute it. You, as the user or commissioner, have the right to use and distribute the software
                as you wish given those who you distribute it also follow the rules of the GPL. You may even choose to
                keep the software secret and only use it for yourself. All I ask is that people who get the software know
                who made it and that they don't infringe on the rights of others to use the same software if they distribute it.
                </p>
                <p>
                You may pay me in bitcoin, or preferably monero. I will need more time and money to do bigger projects,
                obviously. Please note that I have a limited skillset in terms of programming, however if you want something
                sort of simple done I can do that.

                <h2>About this site</h2>
                <p>
                This site was designed to be minimal, with less than 120 lines of css, and no javascript.
                To avoid using javascript, I used a static site generator that I wrote specifically
                for this website.
                </p>
                <p>
                If you like that this website has no hidden trackers, google fonts,
                or really anything that could undermine your privacy, or frankly, your eyes, consider:

                <p>
                All my code is free/libre because I believe in a free and
                private internet. If you like any one of the projects I put out and
                license for free, consider supporting me by donating the following
