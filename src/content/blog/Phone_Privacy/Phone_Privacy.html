<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    Phones are one of the most vulnerable devices we carry around. Most likely, your phone is actually
    a glorified surveillance device that you carry around with you 24/7. It is essential that you 
    secure your phone if you want to maintain privacy on the internet, free of tracking. Keep in mind:
    for people who are not good with software at all, I do list an Iphone as an option but the ideal
    solution would be to not own a phone, until you are experienced enough to flash grapheneOS.
</p>

<h2>Isn't stock android secure enough?</h2>
<p>
    If you update android on a regular basis, it is probably secure enough, however, 
    <a href="../Privacy/Privacy.html">security is not privacy.</a> You can have a secure phone
    and still have your data leaked to the likes of google or facebook.
</p>

<h2>Apple</h2>
<p>
    It's one of the big corporations that can and will still collect your information.
    However, it is actually far less invasive than stock android phones made by samsung and other
    providers. They're also pretty serious about security too; however, the way they go about this
    isn't too ideal. Almost all their apps in their ecosystem still collect information about you,
    but they only send some of it, and only to Apple. The bad part about this is that many of the apps
    are nonfree, and the whole operating system is very locked down. For this reason, I cannot
    recommend the use of Apple products as they are not ethical.
    If you're a free software advocate like me, a better option is:
</p>
<h2>GrapheneOS</h2>
<p>
    In my opinion, 
    <a href="grapheneos.org">this</a>, 
    <a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a>, and 
    <a href="https://calyxos.org/">CalyxOS</a> 
    are the only three ways you're going to get any privacy at all with phones. 
    Unfortuantely, if you're unknowledgeable with phones, the best thing you're going to get is an
    iphone, because I imagine that installing a custom ROM on an android phone would be pretty hard
    for the normies out there.
</p>

<p>
    The OS that I use personally is GrapheneOS. If you install this operating system, you will have to
    remove google from your life forever, due to GAPPs not working with grapheneOS, so BE WARNED! 
    Removing google from your phone entirely is the only way to get privacy out of your phone, however,
    so if you do actually want true privacy, just keep that in mind.
</p>

<p>
    GrapheneOS is actually very usable, if you don't rely on google services. Its user interface is like
    that of stock android, and you can customize it very easily. Installing F-droid will provide you with
    a suite of free/libre applications. Speaking of applications:
</p>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>
    So you've got yourself a privacy and security hardened operating system. Now what?
</p>

<h3>Newpipe</h3>
<p>
    Tired of going on the web version of youtube and getting tracked on their website? Newpipe is a 
    heavily underrated application that allows you to browse youtube, without the frontend tracking and
    fingerprinting. Note that youtube still has your ip and browsing habits when you use newpipe.
    This app is also a soundcloud and peertube frontend, and it is fairly good at being those things too,
    although I personally use those platforms less.
    This app allows you to see and download videos, and although the comments break sometimes,
    it can still on occassion display them properly. Note that you will get capchas while browsing
    on newpipe if you connect via tor.
    I use this app as a youtube frontend on my phone, but use an
    <a href="https://yewtu.be">invidious instance</a> most of the time instead, due to it being free
    and not blocking tor connections. Unrelated to this article, but freetube is a desktop youtube client
    that works well too.
</p>
<h3>Aegis authenticator</h3>
<p>
    Tired of using google authentication for all of your two factor authentication accounts? Aegis
    is a free software implementation of two factor authentication, and can store accounts and generate
    new authentication codes. These apps can be found in F-droid.
</p>
<h3>The simple app suite</h3>
<p>
    This is more like a range of applications and not a single one. Personally, I use the calculator, camera,
    and music apps from this suite of apps instead of the default ones because they have a dark theme. These
    apps are fully free software and they work pretty well for what they are supposed to do.
</p>
<h3>Netguard</h3>
<p>
    This is a firewall that restricts certain apps' access to wifi. This is good for limiting blocking
    wifi connections for big brother applications. However, even if you don't have any big brother applications, netguard
    is still quite useful for limiting data use and also using a dns blocklist without root. Using one can block ads system-wide,
    trackers, malicious websites, and other things you don't want in your life. I use <a href="https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts">Steven Black's</a> blocklist, but you can use any other blocklist too. 
</p>
<p>
    To add a blocklist, install netguard and in the drop-dowm menu select settings > Backup > Hosts file download URL.
    Enter in:
    <br>
    <code>
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/alternates/fakenews-gambling-porn-social/hosts
    </code>
    <br>
    if you are using StevenBlack's blocklist that blocks everything, for example. Then, hit Download hosts file. If you
    turn netguard on, everything should be blocked. Note that this does not work for the Tor browser.
</p>

<h3>Bromite</h3>
<p>
    This is a fork of chromium that is free software and is a privacy and anonymity focused alternative to Vanadium.
    Vanadium is a fairly good browser and is probably the best in terms of security on android, however the one thing
    that annoys me about the browser is that there is no way to open every link in incognito as of right now. Bromite
    can do this, and it also has ad blocking which is important. Note that there is basically no way to block
    non-free javascript in this browser except for turning off javascript, but this is for every browser on android I believe,
    except iceraven, which has security problems like all forks of firefox and firefox itself does.
</p>

<p>
    To install fdroid, <a href="https://www.bromite.org/fdroid">follow this guide to add the fdroid repository</a>,
    then install it via fdroid.
</p>

<h3>Organic Maps</h3>
<p>
    Ever wanted a completely free replacement to google maps? Well, Organic Maps is quite the replacement. It's got a lot
    of functionality depending on where you live, and if there isn't much information about places where you live, you can
    help contribute to OpenStreeetMaps, the free database of places in the world which Organic Maps depends on, yourself.
    As for my city, it already has most of the places where I would like to go to.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    There are some other apps that I would like to list but would probably deserve their own blog post like
    Signal, Element/Fluffychat and the matrix protocol, LBRY, and cryptocurrency related stuff.
</p>
<p>
    Phones are not designed for privacy, security, or anonimity. They are designed to track you, and in order
    to stop that tracking completely, you need to step outside of your comfort zone and basically get rid
    of google. If you're not willing to do this, just don't get a phone, use and Apple phone, but actually don't
    because it's proprietary.
