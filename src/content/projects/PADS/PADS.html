<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    This is a script that I made for <a href="https://prestonpan.tech/content/projects/My_Dotfiles/My_Dotfiles.html">my dotfiles</a>.
    It automatically installs all the packages required in order to have a bare bones desktop experience. It utilizes
    my build of distrotube's build of suckless utilities also.
</p>
<p>
    This script is inspired by Luke Smith's <a href="https://larbs.xyz">LARBS</a>, but it aims to support more distros and it also
    aims to offer a more bare bones experience. Currently, it only supports distros downstream of Debian GNU/Linux and Debian itself,
    such as various flavors of Ubuntu. However, I will support more distros like Void and Arch later on.
</p>
<p>
    Do not use this script if you value your home directory data and have not backed it up. It will delete your home directory and
    replace it with the dotfiles. Also, do not stop the script once it starts running. Otherwise, install the script! It's
    cool. If there is a distro which I do not support, consider contributing to the project and writing a shell script for
    that distro.
