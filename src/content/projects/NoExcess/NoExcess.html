<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  A barebones, compiled, statically typed programming language that nobody uses
  and nobody asked for.
</p>
<p>
  Have you ever programmed in c and thought, "wow, this is legit just so much
  pain I cannot even live anymore"? Introducing a language that's just as bad,
  or worse. Welcome to my own frankenstein creation that is NoExcess. There's no
  excess syntax because I'm lazy. Go ahead! Try it yourself in like 2 years when
  it actually becomes functional, or never because i would be too lazy to finish
  the project.
</p>

<h2>Actual technical information (For people who care)</h2>
<p>
  NoExcess is a very minimal language that I plan to keep close to bare metal.
  It will compile to C at first, but I'll try to get it to compile to assembly
  eventually. Basically, the syntax is supposed to be designed to be much more
  intuitive compared to c. All variables are static by default and pointer
  syntax is much less confusing (in my opinion). Although this will never become
  a working programming language, I wanted too try to make one to see what the
  process was like.
</p>

<h2>The Lexer</h2>
<p>
  As of today, it's the only component that i've done, but basically this is
  supposed to be the easy part. It wasn't too hard, but it takes sort of long to
  write. Writing the parser should be much more time consuming, however.
</p>

<h2>Update 1</h2>
<p>
    NoExcess has been reworked significantly. It is no longer a systems programming language primarily,
    although I plan to expose some APIs to interact with bare metal by adding functions in the standard library
    that map onto x86 instructions. It looks now a lot like lisp, with many features removed to make it as simple
    as possible. The parser/semantic analyzer (they're done at the same stage) are being worked on currently. It should be
    a nice, simple, functional programming language in the future.
